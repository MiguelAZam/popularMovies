# Popular Movies

## Project Overview

In this project, Iâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. The development of this app was divides into two parts:

In the first part the app was be able to:

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - Original title
  - Movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - User rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - Movie release date

In the second part the app is be able to:

- Allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser)
- Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie
- Allow users to mak a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a star checkbox
- User Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle) to create a robust an efficient application.
- Create a database using Room to store the names, ids, release date, overview and poster
- Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorite collection

## Why this Project

To become an Android developer, I must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, I need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. I will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, I will demonstrate my understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. My app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

## What Will I Learn?

Through this project, I will:

- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
- Build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system.
